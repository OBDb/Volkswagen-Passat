generations:
  - name: "First Generation (B1)"
    start_year: 1973
    end_year: 1981
    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Passat (internally designated B1) was introduced as Volkswagen's modern front-wheel drive family car, representing a significant departure from the company's rear-engine, air-cooled heritage. Developed under Volkswagen's ownership of Audi, the Passat was essentially a rebadged Audi 80 with different styling, designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro with clean, angular lines characteristic of his 'folded paper' design philosophy. Available in two-door and four-door fastback sedans and three-door and five-door wagon body styles, the B1 Passat combined modern engineering with practical versatility. Powered by a range of four-cylinder water-cooled engines ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 liters, with a 1.5-liter diesel option added later, all paired with manual or automatic transmissions driving the front wheels, the Passat emphasized efficiency and practicality over performance. The interior featured a straightforward, functional design with good visibility and reasonable space utilization for its compact exterior dimensions. A facelift in 1977 brought revised styling with rectangular headlights replacing the original round units, along with various technical improvements. This generation established the Passat nameplate (derived from the German word for trade wind) and its positioning as Volkswagen's mid-size family car offering, combining modern engineering with practical versatility—a formula that would define subsequent generations."
